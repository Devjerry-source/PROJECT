The difference between two sets gives rise to another set from which the element of the first set that are not in or present in the second set.

94,Blessing Agyei Kyem,SNP_201045 ,"A Set is an ordered, mutable data structure that prohibits duplicate values(repeated values). The elements in a set must be immutable objects. A set is represented like a dictionary using curly brackets. Example {1, 2, 4, 7}",2,set( ),2,"Both are used to remove an element from a list

The difference is that the remove method will give out an error if the element you want to remove is not found in the set but the discard method will not give out an error or would return nothing if the element isn't found in the set ",4,&,2,-,2,"The difference method returns element(s) that is/are found in the Set being called on but not found in the set being passed on as an argument.
Example
A = {1, 2, 4, 8, 10}
B = {1, 3, 7, 10}
print(A.difference(B)) # The output would be {2, 4, 8} because 2, 4, 8 is found in Set A only but not B

The symmetric_method returns element(s) that is/are found in either of the two sets but not both. It doesn't return element(s) shared by both sets. It takes elements that are found exclusively or uniquely in either of the two sets   
Example 
C = { 1, 4, 6, 8, 5, 9}
D = {1, 6, 3, 7, 10}
print(C.symmetric_method(D)) #The output would be {4, 8, 5, 9, 3, 7, 10} because 4,8,5,9,3,7,10 are found exclusively in C and D. To simplify, it takes elements found only in set C and also elements found only in set D 

",4,"The union method merges all the elements that is found in both sets and removes the duplicates 
For example
A = {1, 2, 3}
B = {2, 4, 5}
print(A.union(B)) # output would be {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Because 2 is a duplicate one would be removed

The intersection method returns element(s) that is found in both sets.

print(C.intersection(D)) #output would be {2} because 2 is found in both set C and set D

Supposing I type my code into an editor and save it by the name blessing.py and run the file directly, blessing.py becomes my script because it has been run directly. The script is the current file you are working with.

",2,It returns a list of the attributes in the calculator module and the built in donder ,2,"A script is a file to be executed directly
But
Module is a file to be run in other file


Also
Script function are called
But
Function in an imported module are used as attribute
ALSO
The __name__ in a script run as a script gives  __main__
BUT
The __name__ in a script run as a module gives the module name  ",3,"Python Standard Library is combination or collection of modules or tools built into python to improve(revamp) developer output. They are things built so that developers don't have to build them again
example include string module, math module and others",2,"It represent an attribute that is defined by python and it restores ta module name
It is use for determining whether a file is being used as module or as a script
Printing __name__ in a script run as a script returns  __main__
Printing __name__ in a script run as a module returns the module name  ",3,"The as keyword is used as an alias for an import
And it helps  stress free of using imported module 
e g import calculator as calc
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np",4,"Is different because it is specific, it is flexible you can use it to import everything in the module using * or a specific attribute needed by specifying.
It makes the import to be used not as an attribute
e.g from math import  sqrt
only import the sqrt attribute
so something like sqrt(3) can be run
BUT
import
automatically import all content in the module  as attributes
e.g import math
math.sqrt(3)
the attribute sqrt has been imported
",4,"It might be a bad idea because
1.It result in a name collision(When two names can refer to two different things)
2. It causes confusion
3.It makes the code looks ambiguous",3,"It's recommended because it closes the file immediately the block has finished executing
It doesn't fail if there's a faulty code elsewhere and gives no worry of thinking whether the file has been closed or not.
",3,"The second argument of open function depicts what the file will be used for i.e the processing
e.g if the file is to be read it is given ""r""
If to write It's to be given ""w""
If to append it's to be given ""a""
So available options area ""r"",""w"",""a"" if none given it assumes ""r""(read)",4,"""w"" (write) will create a file and write into it if it doesn't exist
But
""a"" (append) will create a file and add to it if it doesn't exist

""w"" (write) will over-write an existing file
But
""a"" (append) will add to an existing file",4,"Python will create a file with the given name in the same folder the python file is situated and it will write into it
But when used again it will over-write",2,"It raised the FileNotFoundError
When the file is not in the directory the file is situated",2,"higher order function is a function that either accepts a function as an argument or returns a function as a return value

This is possible because function is also an object as everything in python is an object",2,"Because calculate has no return value
The right code should be
def multiply(a, b):
  return a * b
def divide(a, b):
  return a / b
def calculate(func, a, b):
  return func(a, b)

It represent how python make use of assigned data structure in scope. Local is of higher priority and Built in is the lowest. Priority decreases through LEGB",2,"Local variable represent defined inside a block or variable declared inside block of the enclosure
It is only used within the block.
nonlocal keyword can used inside a body of nested function to make the desire not local
But
Global variable is a variable declared outside a block, it is usually at column 1.
It can be used in anywhere even inside a block.
The global keyword can be used to make a variable in  a local block global

Local variable has higher order than global when running a program",4,"closure is a programming pattern in which a scope retains access to an enclosing scope's names
For LEGB it is use in E - The enclosure",2,"It will raise NameError Because function a is called before definition(assigbing, declaration or referencing) of val.
There are two solution approach to this, is either the val is declared before the function definition
or 
a should be called after the declaration of val
Check the solution below
def a():

A decorator enhances a function with another features  without changing the functionality of the function",2,"So Error won't arise when using a decorator
